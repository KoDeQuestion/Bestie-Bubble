## What is the K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

It works by finding hte K nearest neighbors - based on a distance metric (i.e. Euclidean distance).
The class of a data point is determined by the average of the K neighbors.
Basically, you can make predictions based on the local structure of the data.

The algorithm is used for *simplicity* and *ease of implementation*.

* No assumptions required
* Works for numerical and categorical data
* Predicts based on similarity of data points in a given dataset

* Not as sensitive to outliers.

### Make it Easy: Use Euclidean distance!

The cartesian distance between two points in the plane/hyperplane.

### How to choose the K value?

The value of k in the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm should be chosen based on the input data.

* Higher values for noisier data
* Odd values to avoid ties

## Step-by-Step of KNN

[Using this guide.](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-to-implement-k-nearest-neighbors-in-python-from-scratch/)

### 1. Selecting the optimal value of K

### 2. Calculating distance

```python3
# calculate the Euclidean distance between two vectors
def euclidean_distance(row1, row2):
	distance = 0.0
	for i in range(len(row1)-1):
		distance += (row1[i] - row2[i])**2
	return sqrt(distance)
```
For a test data set of iris sepal/petal dimensions...
```python3
# Example of calculating Euclidean distance
from math import sqrt

# calculate the Euclidean distance between two vectors
def euclidean_distance(row1, row2):
	distance = 0.0
	for i in range(len(row1)-1):
		distance += (row1[i] - row2[i])**2
	return sqrt(distance)

# Test distance function
dataset = [[2.7810836,2.550537003,0],
	[1.465489372,2.362125076,0],
	[3.396561688,4.400293529,0],
	[1.38807019,1.850220317,0],
	[3.06407232,3.005305973,0],
	[7.627531214,2.759262235,1],
	[5.332441248,2.088626775,1],
	[6.922596716,1.77106367,1],
	[8.675418651,-0.242068655,1],
	[7.673756466,3.508563011,1]]
row0 = dataset[0]
for row in dataset:
	distance = euclidean_distance(row0, row)
	print(distance)
```
### 3. Finding Nearest Neighbors

```python3
# Locate the most similar neighbors
def get_neighbors(train, test_row, num_neighbors):
	distances = list()
	for train_row in train:
		dist = euclidean_distance(test_row, train_row)
		distances.append((train_row, dist))
	distances.sort(key=lambda tup: tup[1])
	neighbors = list()
	for i in range(num_neighbors):
		neighbors.append(distances[i][0])
	return neighbors
```

Test Data Example:

```python3
# Example of getting neighbors for an instance
from math import sqrt

# calculate the Euclidean distance between two vectors
def euclidean_distance(row1, row2):
	distance = 0.0
	for i in range(len(row1)-1):
		distance += (row1[i] - row2[i])**2
	return sqrt(distance)

# Locate the most similar neighbors
def get_neighbors(train, test_row, num_neighbors):
	distances = list()
	for train_row in train:
		dist = euclidean_distance(test_row, train_row)
		distances.append((train_row, dist))
	distances.sort(key=lambda tup: tup[1])
	neighbors = list()
	for i in range(num_neighbors):
		neighbors.append(distances[i][0])
	return neighbors

# Test distance function
dataset = [[2.7810836,2.550537003,0],
	[1.465489372,2.362125076,0],
	[3.396561688,4.400293529,0],
	[1.38807019,1.850220317,0],
	[3.06407232,3.005305973,0],
	[7.627531214,2.759262235,1],
	[5.332441248,2.088626775,1],
	[6.922596716,1.77106367,1],
	[8.675418651,-0.242068655,1],
	[7.673756466,3.508563011,1]]
neighbors = get_neighbors(dataset, dataset[0], 3)
for neighbor in neighbors:
	print(neighbor)
```

### 4. Predictions/Voting for Classification/Taking Average for Regression

```python3
# Make a classification prediction with neighbors
def predict_classification(train, test_row, num_neighbors):
	neighbors = get_neighbors(train, test_row, num_neighbors)
	output_values = [row[-1] for row in neighbors]
	prediction = max(set(output_values), key=output_values.count)
	return prediction
```

```python3
# Example of making predictions
from math import sqrt

# calculate the Euclidean distance between two vectors
def euclidean_distance(row1, row2):
	distance = 0.0
	for i in range(len(row1)-1):
		distance += (row1[i] - row2[i])**2
	return sqrt(distance)

# Locate the most similar neighbors
def get_neighbors(train, test_row, num_neighbors):
	distances = list()
	for train_row in train:
		dist = euclidean_distance(test_row, train_row)
		distances.append((train_row, dist))
	distances.sort(key=lambda tup: tup[1])
	neighbors = list()
	for i in range(num_neighbors):
		neighbors.append(distances[i][0])
	return neighbors

# Make a classification prediction with neighbors
def predict_classification(train, test_row, num_neighbors):
	neighbors = get_neighbors(train, test_row, num_neighbors)
	output_values = [row[-1] for row in neighbors]
	prediction = max(set(output_values), key=output_values.count)
	return prediction

Test Example:

# Test distance function
dataset = [[2.7810836,2.550537003,0],
	[1.465489372,2.362125076,0],
	[3.396561688,4.400293529,0],
	[1.38807019,1.850220317,0],
	[3.06407232,3.005305973,0],
	[7.627531214,2.759262235,1],
	[5.332441248,2.088626775,1],
	[6.922596716,1.77106367,1],
	[8.675418651,-0.242068655,1],
	[7.673756466,3.508563011,1]]
prediction = predict_classification(dataset, dataset[0], 3)
print('Expected %d, Got %d.' % (dataset[0][-1], prediction))
